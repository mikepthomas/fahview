Significance Of My Work

  The project is significant as the it will help make the Folding@home project
  easier to use, and more accessible to the masses which in turn will enable an
  increase in client use to increase research for the Stanford Pande Lab.

Summary

  The Folding@home client is a complex piece of software; if the project is to
  be completed successfully it must be understood thoroughly. This can be
  achieved by effective research of the problem domain and will be soon starting
  work of collecting requirements and creating preliminary designs for the
  system.

  The next chapter will focus on the requirements collection, design,
  implementation and testing of the first iteration of the project which will
  look at the extraction of data from the current and past stable releases of
  the Folding@home client.
