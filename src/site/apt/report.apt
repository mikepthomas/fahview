Report Structure

  This work shall start off with an introduction to this project itself and give
  a brief overview of Folding@home from which it is based upon. This will lead
  on to the initial planning stage of the project which will explain about the
  project management elements that will occur during the lifetime of the
  project. A thorough Literature review will then be carried out to research the
  problem domain that will then lead on to prospective solutions that could be
  used to code a reasonable solution to overcome the shortcomings of the
  Folding@home project. The next section shall then look at the requirements to
  be collected for the proposed new system that can then be used as a basis of a
  test plan. The design of user interfaces and code will come next leading to
  the final implementation of the program. The program will eventually be tested
  against the initial requirements to ensure that whatâ€™s produced fits what is
  required. The final section of this report will evaluate and conclude the
  finished product.
