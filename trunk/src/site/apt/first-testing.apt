About

  To ensure the completed system will meet the requirements set out in the
  requirements section of this document, the system will need to be tested using
  a number of different techniques. There are many ways to test systems such as
  mine, however I am going to concentrate on two methods. Black box testing and
  white box testing.

Test Data

  The test data that will be used during this iteration has been generated from
  an actual Folding@home client that has been run on my local machine for over a
  year to ensure I have a good base of data to test against, I have also
  acquired test data from other people running various different clients using
  different operating systems.

Test Plans

  Test plans will need to be created to test the implemented system against
  known good values, theses values need to be ensured to be true, this will be
  attained using a hex editor on the queue.dat file to extract known good values
  from the file to use in the test plan to test against values extracted using
  my program.
