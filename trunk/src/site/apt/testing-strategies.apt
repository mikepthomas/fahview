Black box testing

  Black box testing is achieved by ensuring expected outputs match actual
  outputs when known inputs are used. I will be doing black box testing in the
  form of unit testing using the JUnit framework.

White box testing

  “White-box testing is testing that takes into account the internal mechanism
  of a system or component” (IEEE, 1990).

  White box testing is ensuring code is doing what is expected by physically
  looking at the internal workings of the code, this will be achieved by
  stepping through the lines of code using a debugger to ensure that it doing as
  it should be.

Integration testing

  The main purpose of the project is to produce a cross platform viewer for the
  Windows, Linux and Mac operating systems. I would also like to ensure the
  viewer works against GPU clients also therefore integration testing is
  essential.
