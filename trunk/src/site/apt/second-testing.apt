About

  To ensure the completed system will meet the requirements set out in the
  requirements section of this document, the system will need to be tested using
  a number of different techniques. There are many ways to test systems such as
  mine, however I am going to concentrate on two methods. Black box testing and
  white box testing.

Test Data

  The test data for this iteration has been collected from the same data pool
  that was used in the previous iteration. However, the data collected from
  other people did not include the 3D model data due to the large size of the
  work unit files, between 10 âˆ’ 100MB.

Test Plans

  Tests will be carried out on multiple data files.
